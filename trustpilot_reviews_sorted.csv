What a let down and pretty frustrating at that, as there is a multitude of things you can do on it. But reading some of the horror stories here I don't think i'll be signing up anytime soon. Tons of bad reviews, about time this company got its act together. Firstly. Not all of us are big shot producers with a ton of money hanging out our pockets, all we want is a fair priced software to meet our needs, we are willing to pay for it. Your prices i've seen so far are ridiculous, oh yes i know it doesn't come cheap putting this programme together and maintaining it, but make it affordable, stop the shady goings on, like people not being able to end their account at any time. Like giving it now for say $79 and then once the year is up you get hit with $179 out one's account, because you failed in some way to uncheck or check the box to stop automatic purchase on sign up. A yearly fee so you have a choice or carry on using your version you paid for. I would love this software but with what i'm reading here only when i see a marked improvement in pricing and contracts, i am able to cancel at anytime, easy to reach a human being if any problems arise, only then will i sign up. The text to voice generator is pointless now as on the free version i used it yesterday it gave me one voice and then everyone i tried you gotta pay. I want the software but not until i stop seeing bad reviews and the amount of them here is enough to put anyone off. You must be reading these reviews the owners of this company...?? Sort it out, your killing this software. Cut your monthly prices or make it a one off price, No tied in contracts, if its a monthly ""A cancel anytime"" attachment. So you know when it's cancelled its actually cancelled. Personally for me a one off payment with no tie into any contract.",2,0,en,Organic,2025-11-25,2025-11-25,yawroc Corway,GB,True,False

However, I encountered significant issues related to billing and customer support after subscribing to the premium features. I subscribed to the premium features for 14 months, paying $9.99 (CAD) per month via PayPal. Upon canceling the auto-renewal, I discovered that I had been charged an additional $13.49 each month. Notably, these additional charges did not occur on a consistent date, making them more difficult to identify. I acknowledge that I did not initially recognize this discrepancy, as the transaction name simply displayed ""CapCut."" I disputed these charges, which initiated a two-week-long process. During this period, I was required to repeatedly provide the same information. The support team consistently inquired about the source of the $13.49 charges, which originated directly from my debit card, despite my repeated assertions that I had no other accounts. They were unable to assist in identifying the source of these charges, even when I provided all available details. They repeatedly requested that I log into my CapCut account to access billing information, despite my clear explanation that I had no other account associated with the service. The only explanation I received was that the charges were associated with a ""Log Out"" account, which was unhelpful. While I eventually received a refund for the disputed charges, the customer support experience was exceptionally poor. The support team's lack of responsiveness and inability to address my concerns was extremely frustrating.

It’s now been over a month — no refund, no product, and only repeated template responses saying that my “refund was processed on September 23rd,” which is impossible because at that time they were still denying it! Neither my bank nor PayPal have any record of a refund ever being issued. I’ve already contacted PayPal and the European Consumer Centre, and I’m preparing legal action if this isn’t resolved soon. This looks like a classic subscription trap — misleading, dishonest, and unethical behavior towards customers.

No email. The only thing you can do is fill out their form. So I did just that. 2 more weeks go by and no response. So, I filled out another form.

I purchased CapCut Teams (2 seats, yearly) on Sept 11, 2025, so my daughter (creator) and I could collaborate. Over a month later, the subscription still does NOT work. The invite link is always expired the moment it’s generated. My daughter cannot join my Team space. This means the core product I paid for — collaboration — is completely broken. I have contacted CapCut Support countless times with screenshots, IDs, receipts, and step-by-step documentation. Instead of helping, they’ve: • Sent me the same generic copy-paste instructions over and over. • Contradicted themselves (first claiming I was in California and my daughter in the Philippines — we both live in the same home in Texas). • Claimed my valid CapCut ID “does not exist” even after previously acknowledging it. • Sent multiple “Your issue is resolved” emails — when nothing was resolved. • Asked me for information that either doesn’t exist in the app or that I had already provided multiple times. They have claimed multiple times that I don't even exist in their system even though I've sent them screenshots of paying $240 for their two team sub subscription from Apple. I've sent them my CC ID, UID, my DID my team space name my core space name everything they've asked me I have sent them not just the numbers and names but the screenshots from their app, and the gross gaslighting and incompetence continues and there's nothing more annoying than sending them all these things and then receiving a generic email saying could you please tell us more about your issue. I have wasted weeks of emails, screenshots, and time in chat queues (400+ people long, often getting kicked out at #1) — and still, no working solution!!! Meanwhile, my daughter, who is a young creator and was excited at my gift at first, has lost over a month of content creation and collaboration opportunities because she cannot access the space I paid for. This was purchased as a gift to empower her creativity — instead it has caused frustration, stress, disappointment and lost momentum. At this point, after so many emails and gaslighting back-and-forth this is clearly theft of service. CapCut has taken my money, wasted my time, and failed to deliver what was purchased!! I have every single interaction with them that goes on and on enough to create a whole book of back-and-forth nonsense from them. They have closed my ticket every day since Thursday with nothing actually been resolved. I cannot begin to express the frustration of the wild goose chase that I have been on with them.!!! ⚠️ Warning to others: • CapCut Teams is misleadingly marketed and DIES NOT WORK!!!! Buying a 2-seat plan does not actually give two people Pro features — only collaboration space. • Even that collaboration space is unreliable and, in my case, completely unusable. • Support is slow, evasive, dismissive, and repeatedly closes tickets without solving anything!!!! . CapCut boasts thousands of users , but this experience proves they do not stand behind their product or their paying customers.

Today, I found out they are now limiting unpaid users to 6 free exports per week. If you go beyond that they stick a big fat watermark on your video (the video isn't even watchable anymore because of how big it is). I'd happily pay for CapCut again if they were to decrease the price. Hell, if they decrease the price and remove a few pro features that's fine. But 40 NZD when I might as well get Adobe?

So replace the name Bytedance by CapCut if that's needed, in any way, either ByteDance and CapCut have ver bad feedbacks ! I am adding my voice to the very upset ones !! On November 2024 I purchased a one year subscription to CapCut (a Bytedance product) in the frame of a promotion : the cost was €109.99 for 1 year of Pro advantages. On December 2024 (1 month later !) I faced serious computer issues that forced me to format my computer. I re-installed CapCut, but surpringly I lost all the advantages of my subscription. Since then I wrote to Bytedance/CapCut to ask what happened and to give me back my subscription advantages for the one year I paid or to send me a refund for not being able to access for the things I paid ! Bytedance started to play the fool with me, telling me different versions : sometimes they said they don't find any subscription related to that date and some other times they say I purchased a numeric service and as it is numeric, it is not refundable! I struggled with them during months, I sent them EVERYTHING they asked, but nothing changed ! As I needed a video editor to create my videoclips for my songs, I took another 1 year subscription in February 2025, without the full price that time (€199.99) as the promotion has been removed In start of August 2025, I received an email from Bytedance telling me they sent me a refund for my purchase... I thought they finally refunded me for the November 2024's subscription, but I nopted something very strange : The amount of the refund was €199.99... I thought they made a mistake, so I wrote to them telling them they refunded me €90.00 They refunded me €90.00 too much and that I will, of course, refund them the excess made by mistake.

They decided to refund me for that purchase (proof that they perfectly can refund a digital service in a blatant contradiction with one of the versions they have been claiming since December 2024 !!!), and wrote to me today to tell me that the screen cap I send proved my order has been refund !!!!

The app is overpriced for what it offers, seems to be outdated or not well-executed. AI-generated images often aren’t that engaging with the content, leading to manual adjustments which takes ages. Creating videos is time-consuming, as the app requires manual refreshing every time you make changes, and those refreshes take too long. It also struggled recognizing some basic English words and numbers from my script, often replacing them with incorrect or irrelevant terms that I could not change or amend even after refreshing. Another major issue is the inconsistency between the mobile and desktop versions. Switching between the two can disrupt your workflow and sometimes can mess up with the original content that you don’t want editing. I find myself restarting the projects rather than finishing them. It's not user-friendly. You need to sit and work on it for a while to get to know the app or be good at it. I was able to complete couple of videos using the app, but one of them was blocked on You Tube due to a copyright issue on background music that was auto-selected by the app’s AI — suggesting that not all the included music is royalty-free. This can be a problem for content creators. While the app can technically get the job done, it comes with too many frustrations throughout the process.

Lo que encontré fue preocupante: el proceso de cancelación está innecesariamente complicado, especialmente si pagas con tarjeta desde la computadora. No hay opción directa en la app, y tienes que buscar un portal externo para desactivar la renovación automática. Esta táctica parece diseñada para que los usuarios se frustren, se olviden o no logren cancelar a tiempo, lo cual considero una forma de chantaje comercial. No es transparente, no es ético, y definitivamente no genera confianza. Las funciones de edición pueden ser buenas, pero si una empresa necesita esconder el botón de “cancelar” para retener clientes, algo está mal. No recomiendo CapCut a nadie que valore la claridad y el respeto al consumidor. I considered trying CapCut’s free trial to explore its features, but before accepting, I looked into how to cancel the subscription. What I found was disappointing: the cancellation process is unnecessarily complicated, especially if you pay by credit card on desktop. There’s no direct option in the app—you have to dig through an external portal just to disable auto-renewal. This feels like a deliberate tactic to frustrate users, hoping they’ll forget or give up before the trial ends. In my opinion, that’s commercial blackmail. It’s not transparent, it’s not ethical, and it certainly doesn’t inspire trust.

I have one account where I was paying €11.99/month for Pro. One day, I tried exporting a video but couldn’t. The payment hadn’t gone through, even though it's usually automatic and I had money in my account. I tried to pay the €11.99 again, but it only allowed a €14.99 payment. I paid it, but still couldn’t export. I signed out, closed the app, signed in again — nothing. It kept asking me to upgrade. I assumed the payment failed. While trying to resolve it, I had to use Veed’s free service (with watermark) for my YouTube videos. Eventually, I paid €149.99 for the yearly plan — same result. Still asking for a €29.99 subscription. I thought there was only one pricing plan. I ended up paying €29.99 too. I assumed previous payments would be cancelled since I was using the same account. I only have one. So I paid: €11.99/month (original) €14.99/month (retry) €149.99/year €29.99/month I complained to CapCut. After many vague replies, they finally said: ""...virtual products do not support refunds... both subscriptions will extend validity one by one as they do not overlap."" But on July 14, 2025, the second payment should’ve taken effect — instead, they charged me €149.99 again. So, yes, they did overlap. After all these payments, I still have no Pro services since July 14. I paid 3× the amount and got nothing. I’m still using Veed with watermarks even though I’ve paid multiple times for Pro. Support keeps asking the same questions repeatedly: if I paid via CapCut App/Web/PC or third-party? I’ve answered that 6 times. After over a month of back-and-forth, they finally said: ""Sorry to hear about your bad experience. Please apply for a refund according to your purchase channel or provide the following: 1 - CapCut UID / CCID / email 2 - Payment screenshot with order number and amount"" I did that. Then I got an email asking to review a ticket that had been closed. Shortly after, another email: ""We're so sorry you're facing this trouble due to a wrong purchase.

68728eebd309f6981fc0ca3f,I used the Paid Version. Capcut Pro,"I used the free version, all Ok. I upgraded to Capcut Pro paying £199.00 for a year. I use the image to video feature a lot, it was quite simple and your available credits were visible on the page so you could keep track. Average wait time for this function to complete was 15 Minutes. After I paid, the available credits no longer showed, and no matter where I looked on the site they are not showing. Also the time no taken to process an image to video is now over 1 hour. It always states 52 Minutes wait, Then when it gets to 99%, a message pops ups saying lots of people are generating this could take some time, and it does, sometimes up to another hour. It also seems to be extremely sensitive to skin, so if someone is in a swimsuit, or has bare shoulders. It will be rejected as inappropriate content. You would have been waiting at least an hour by then. I have contacted customer services, They appears no way to do this on the website or App, I had to look the email address online. You get an automatic reply. Then nothing. I have sent about 6 emails over the last 3 weeks, not one has been replied to. I am stuck with this for a year, but won’t be renewing. My advice. Don’t use Capcut, Product is Ok, but if you run into a problem, you are well and truly stuck. 81% one star review.

687156b833e2bea2ea59dbd5,"Titl CapCut Is a Scam — Double Charges, No Access, No Support!e","Review: CapCut is by far one of the worst services I’ve ever dealt with. They’ve been charging me twice every month for the same CapCut Pro subscription — that’s $9.99 x2 monthly — and yet, for the last four months I’ve had ZERO access to the Pro version. I contacted their support team multiple times. Either I get no response at all for weeks, or they reply with generic answers that don’t even address my complaint. It feels like they just don’t care — they keep taking people’s money and ignore you when something goes wrong. I asked for a refund for all the months I was double charged and denied access, but still nothing has been done. They just keep charging my account while offering no solution. This is a scam. If you’re considering paying for CapCut Pro, don’t. Their billing system is broken, their support is useless, and their service is unreliable. Avoid this app until they fix their system and treat paying users with honesty and respect.",1,0,en,Organic,2025-07-11,2025-07-11,Ted,US,False,False

Now they claim that just by uploading your videos, you’re giving them a lifetime license to use your content however they like—even for ads or commercial purposes—without telling you, asking for your permission, or paying you anything. What’s worse? They can delete your account any time, for no reason, and they’re not responsible if your stuff gets lost. I’ve already deleted the app and I don’t accept these unfair rules. Platforms can make money, sure—but not at the cost of creators who put in time, effort, and personal expression. If you create your own work—music, videos, drawings—think twice before uploading anything here.

6869f9ed60a3ed27552d0043,These people are monsters,"These people are monsters. I am very serious. Since February I've accidentally purchased twice the yearly pro membership by pressing again. I was actually surprised Capcut could still take the money instead of writing something like ""you are already in a pro membership"". I saw the double purchase via PayPal and contacted the Capcut customer support to get a politically correct email pretending to care : ""We're extremely grateful for your continuous support! We totally get how disappointed you must feel about the purchase you have made by mistake. Unfortunately, since virtual products do not support refunds, we are unable to process a refund for you. But please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any problems or suggestions during future use. We're here to help!"" I've explained ""what if I accidentally pressed 10 times ? You would charge me 600 dollars ?"" I am very surprised how such a big company like Capcut can think. My emails got ignored or taken by another member from the staff who was asking me the question again and again. Even now, I've been answered my last email from April in July, to get the... exact same answer. I wonder if they hire low quality staff paid for writing politically correct emails with 0 empathy for the customer, or even proceed with an incapable AI. Who knows. I didn't know such a ""successful"" company could be that cheap in stealing (yes, it is STEALING) honest people's money.

Time. No resume button, no progress saving, just pure frustration. Like we’re back in 1933 before downloads were invented. Subtitles? Might as well be done by a toddler smashing a keyboard with jelly hands. Support? Copy-paste template that says nothing and solves less. If you're a serious content creator who actually cares about quality, CapCut is simply not good enough. It looks like a tool for creators, but it’s really more of a toy for casuals who only need 10-second glitter edits for TikTok. Bottom line: CapCut is not a professional tool.

686985f136b1917d52a60df9,suggestion: Pro Plan suspended before end date – CapCut does not solve the issue,"I purchased my CapCut Pro subscription on November 2, 2024, with validity until November 2, 2025. However, I started receiving multiple emails with a countdown warning me that my subscription would expire on June 4, 2025—many months before the correct expiration date. As a result, my plan was suspended prematurely, forcing me to stop several ongoing projects. This caused significant financial losses and wasted time. I replied to those emails explaining that my subscription period had not yet ended and even attached my payment receipt, but I received no helpful response. I also submitted feedback through the app itself, attaching the proof of purchase, but received only a vague reply telling me to ""add more information,"" even though I used the same account and email as the subscription. I demand immediate reactivation of my plan until the correct end date (November 2, 2025) or a proportional refund for the months I will be unable to use. In addition, I request compensation or reimbursement for the damages caused, especially for the time and work lost on my projects due to this failure. I also expect a clear and objective response from the support team, which has so far ignored the problem.",1,0,en,Organic,2025-07-05,2025-07-01,Wesley BlackCoch,BR,False,False
68667581853b5fe8512beca2,Capcut is a total scam!,"This application is a total scam!! Watch out. They suggest a free trial of 7 days and then charge you 299€ on day 6 of your trial through your credit card on the Apple account! I downloaded the free version to edit a movie, when I wanted to download the movie, the app displayed a pop up saying I could not download the movie because I had used Pro features for which I should be a paying customer. When I used the features the app did not display any pop up to say I needed a pro account to use them. The only solution suggested by capcut itself was to take a 7day free trial so I could download the edit I made. I went with the free trial to download my movie and put an alarm a day before the trial ended to cut of the trial before it extended into a paying customer. But the app already charged me on day 6!! This is not a cheap scam either, the app charges 299€ for using it! I contacted the customer service of the app and they openly admitted that they charge 24hrs before the trial ends. No refunds they say! I asked to be put in contact with the legal department. But this is completely outrageous that they charge before the free trial ends.
